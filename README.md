# AwesomeWM

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/oCYxAla.png "AwesomeWM Screenshot")

- This config is using FreeDesktop and a heavily modified version of the PowerArrow Theme
- I suggest using XFCE as a base to install AwesomeWM, as this config is looking for a number of standard XFCE programs to function correctly
- The compositor in use is Picom, the config for this is expected to be found in .config/picom/picom.conf

# Qtile

- Config is an edited version of the default config provided by ArcoLinux
- As with the AwesomeWM config, a number of XFCE programs are expected to be installed
- Workplace Icons on the bar are from the Font Awesome 5 Free pack, without this installed you will only see text instead of the workplace icons
- Compositor in use is Picom. Config is expected to be in .config/qtile/scripts/picom.conf
- Picom fork in use is from https://github.com/jonaburg/picom

# i3-Gaps

- I'm no longer supporting i3-gaps as I just don't ever feel the need to use it. This can still provide you with a good starting point though
- This is still a work in progress, however all the underlying configurations all work as intended
- Similar to my AwesomeWM config, a number of standard XFCE programs are required
- Top bar is Polybar, config for this is included
- Font used on Polybar is Ubuntu Regular
- The compositor in use is Picom, the config for this is expected to be found in .config/picom.conf
